# Vaulty - Context Memory System for Claude

A template repository designed to give Claude persistent context memory and specialized agent capabilities. This system enables Claude to maintain consistent workflows, reference best practices, and manage projects effectively across sessions.

## 🎯 What is Vaulty?

Vaulty is an **Obsidian vault** that serves as a comprehensive context memory system for Claude. It provides:

- **Memory Files**: Best practices and guidelines for different domains (git, testing, deployment, etc.)
- **Language-Specific Best Practices**: Detailed guides for 12 programming languages with idioms, patterns, and tooling
- **Specialized Agents**: Expert personas that Claude can invoke for specific tasks
- **Project Management**: Structured system for tracking projects and tasks
- **Agent Collaboration**: Workflows where agents work together (Developer → Tester → Auditor → Git)

## 🔀 Using This Template Repository

Vaulty is designed as a **GitHub Template Repository** for personal use. Choose your path:

### 👤 For Personal Use (Recommended)

**This is the most common use case** - create your own copy to customize for your workflow:

1. **Click "Use this template"** button on GitHub (or [use this link](../../generate))
2. Choose a name for your repository (e.g., `my-vaulty`, `claude-memory`)
3. Select **Private** or **Public** (your choice)
4. Click "Create repository from template"
5. Clone your new repository and customize it

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Your own independent copy (no fork relationship)
- ✅ Customize agents, memory files, and config for your needs
- ✅ Add your personal projects without cluttering the template
- ✅ Pull updates from the template when you want them
- ✅ No expectation to contribute back (unless you want to!)

### 🤝 For Contributing to Vaulty Framework

**Want to improve Vaulty for everyone?** We welcome contributions!

1. **Fork this repository** (not "Use this template")
2. Make improvements to core framework files (agents, memory files, templates)
3. Submit a Pull Request
4. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines

**What to contribute:**
- New memory files for domains (security, performance, etc.)
- New programming language guides
- Improved agent workflows
- Bug fixes and documentation
- Example projects and use cases

**What NOT to contribute:**
- Your personal `config.md` settings

### 🔄 Staying Updated

If you used the template and want to pull in new improvements:

```bash
# Add the original template as a remote (one time)
git remote add template https://github.com/rhwendt/vaulty.git

# Check what's new in the template
git fetch template
git show template/main:CHANGELOG.md

# Merge updates when ready
git merge template/main --allow-unrelated-histories

# Resolve any conflicts (usually just in framework files)
```

**Track updates:**
- 📋 View **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** for version history
- ⭐ Watch releases on GitHub for notifications
- 📌 Check [GitHub Releases](../../releases) for new versions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vaulty.git
cd vaulty
```

### 2. Open in Obsidian

1. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
2. Open Obsidian
3. Click "Open folder as vault"
4. Select the `vaulty` directory

### 3. Configure Your Personal Settings ⚙️

**IMPORTANT**: Create your personal config file before using Vaulty!

```bash
# Copy the template to create your config
cp config.template.md config.md

# Edit config.md with your preferences
# (use your favorite editor)
```

Your `config.md` contains personal settings like:
- Where you store your code repos locally (`repos_directory`)
- Your preferred programming languages and frameworks
- Your git preferences (default branch, commit style)
- Your code style preferences (indentation, line length)
- Your testing preferences (frameworks, coverage requirements)
- Your deployment setup (cloud provider, CI/CD platform)
- And much more!

**Why this matters**: Every agent and memory file references your config to personalize their behavior. Claude will use your preferred tools, follow your code style, and work with your local directory structure.

> [!TIP]
> Don't worry about filling out everything at once. Start with the basics (name, repos_directory, default_branch) and add more as needed. The template has detailed examples for every setting.

### 4. Start Using with Claude

When interacting with Claude in this repository:

**For Git Operations:**
```
"Commit these changes to git"
```
