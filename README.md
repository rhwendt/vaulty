# Vaulty - Context Memory System for Claude

A template repository designed to give Claude persistent context memory and specialized agent capabilities. This system enables Claude to maintain consistent workflows, reference best practices, and manage projects effectively across sessions.

## 🎯 What is Vaulty?

Vaulty is an **Obsidian vault** that serves as a comprehensive context memory system for Claude. It provides:

- **Memory Files**: Best practices and guidelines for different domains (git, testing, deployment, etc.)
- **Language-Specific Best Practices**: Detailed guides for 12 programming languages with idioms, patterns, and tooling
- **Specialized Agents**: Expert personas that Claude can invoke for specific tasks
- **Project Management**: Structured system for tracking projects and tasks
- **Agent Collaboration**: Workflows where agents work together (Developer → Tester → Auditor → Git)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vaulty.git
cd vaulty
```

### 2. Open in Obsidian

1. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
2. Open Obsidian
3. Click "Open folder as vault"
4. Select the `vaulty` directory

### 3. Configure Your Personal Settings ⚙️

**IMPORTANT**: Create your personal config file before using Vaulty!

```bash
# Copy the template to create your config
cp config.template.md config.md

# Edit config.md with your preferences
# (use your favorite editor)
```

Your `config.md` contains personal settings like:
- Where you store your code repos locally (`repos_directory`)
- Your preferred programming languages and frameworks
- Your git preferences (default branch, commit style)
- Your code style preferences (indentation, line length)
- Your testing preferences (frameworks, coverage requirements)
- Your deployment setup (cloud provider, CI/CD platform)
- And much more!

**Why this matters**: Every agent and memory file references your config to personalize their behavior. Claude will use your preferred tools, follow your code style, and work with your local directory structure.

> [!TIP]
> Don't worry about filling out everything at once. Start with the basics (name, repos_directory, default_branch) and add more as needed. The template has detailed examples for every setting.

### 4. Start Using with Claude

When interacting with Claude in this repository:

**For Git Operations:**
```
"Commit these changes to git"
```
→ Claude will use the Git Agent and reference `memory/git-workflow.md`

**For Development:**
```
"Write a Python script to process JSON files"
```
→ Claude will use Developer Agent → Tester Agent → Auditor Agent → Git Agent workflow

**For Project Management:**
```
"Create a new project for building a REST API"
```
→ Claude will use Project Manager Agent and create structured project files

### Development Workflow Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Trigger Words |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Developer** | Write and modify code | "write", "implement", "create script", "fix bug" |
| **Tester** | Write and run tests | "test", "write tests", "check coverage" |
| **Auditor** | Review code for quality/security | "review", "audit", "check for issues" |

## 🔄 Agent Collaboration Workflows

### Complete Feature Development

When you ask Claude to implement a feature, agents collaborate:

```
1. Project Manager → Creates/tracks task
2. Architect → Designs high-level architecture (if major)
3. Software Design → Designs code structure
4. Developer → Implements code
5. Tester → Writes and runs tests
   ↓ (if tests fail, back to Developer)
6. Auditor → Reviews for quality and security
   ↓ (if review fails, back to Developer)
7. Git → Commits and pushes code
8. Documentation → Updates docs
9. Deployment → Deploys to environments
10. Project Manager → Marks task complete
```

### Quick Bug Fix

```
1. Debugger → Investigates and finds root cause
2. Developer → Implements fix
3. Tester → Adds regression test
4. Auditor → Reviews fix
5. Git → Commits fix
6. Deployment → Deploys hotfix
```

## 📝 Memory Files

Memory files contain best practices that agents reference:

- **git-workflow.md**: How to commit, branch, create PRs
- **testing-qa.md**: Testing standards, coverage requirements
- **code-review.md**: Code review checklist, security concerns
- **deployment.md**: Deployment procedures, rollback plans
- **architecture-design.md**: Design patterns, SOLID principles
- **project-management.md**: Task tracking, project organization
- **documentation.md**: Documentation standards

| **Java** | Streams, Optional, Spring Boot, JUnit 5, modern features |
| **C#** | Async/await, LINQ, nullable types, xUnit, .NET patterns |
| **C++** | Modern C++, RAII, smart pointers, move semantics |
| **PHP** | PHP 8+, Laravel, type safety, PSR standards, PHPUnit |
| **Ruby** | Ruby idioms, Rails, RSpec, metaprogramming |
| **Swift** | Optionals, protocols, SwiftUI, value types, XCTest |
| **Kotlin** | Null safety, coroutines, sealed classes, data classes |

**What's included in each language guide:**
- ✅ Language philosophy and idioms

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Start a New Project

```
You: "Create a new project for building a task management API"

Claude will:
1. Use Project Manager Agent
2. Create projects/task-management-api/
3. Create overview.md from template
4. Create initial task breakdown
5. Reference memory/project-management.md for structure
```

### Example 2: Implement a Feature

```
You: "Write a Python function to validate email addresses"

Claude will:
1. Use Developer Agent (references memory/architecture-design.md)
2. Write the function with proper error handling
3. Use Tester Agent (references memory/testing-qa.md)
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Use Auditor Agent (references memory/code-review.md)
6. Review for security and quality
7. Use Git Agent (references memory/git-workflow.md)
8. Commit with proper message
```

### Example 3: Deploy Changes

```
You: "Deploy this to production"

Claude will:
1. Use Deployment Agent
2. Reference memory/deployment.md
3. Run pre-deployment checklist
4. Execute deployment steps
5. Monitor deployment
6. Report status
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Memory Files

Create a new file in `memory/` for your domain:

```markdown
#memory/your-domain

# Your Domain Best Practices

## When to Use
...

## Best Practices
...
```

### Adding Custom Agents

Create a new agent in `agents/`:

```markdown
#agent #your-specialty

# Your Custom Agent

## Role
What this agent does...

## Key Memory Files
- [[memory/relevant-file]]

## Trigger Patterns
- "trigger word 1"
- "trigger word 2"
```

Then update `.claude.md` to include your new agent's trigger patterns.

### Creating Projects

Use the templates in `projects/_templates/`:

```bash
# Create new project structure
mkdir -p projects/my-new-project/tasks

# Copy templates
cp projects/_templates/project-overview-template.md projects/my-new-project/overview.md
```
