# Vaulty: Context Memory System for Claude

This repository is a context memory system designed to help Claude maintain consistent behavior and reference best practices across different tasks and projects. It contains memory files, agent prompts, and project structures that Claude should use when assisting with various activities.

## How This System Works

1. **User Configuration** (`config.md`): Personal settings and preferences (ALWAYS CHECK FIRST)
2. **Memory Files** (`memory/`): Store best practices and guidelines for different domains
3. **Agent Prompts** (`agents/`): Specialized agent personas that reference memory files
4. **Projects** (`projects/`): Structured project management with tasks and tracking

## 🔧 User Configuration (CHECK FIRST!)

> [!CRITICAL]
> **ALWAYS read [[config]] BEFORE any operation!**
>
> The user's `config.md` file contains their personal preferences and settings. Every agent and memory file references this config. You MUST check it to:
> - Use user's preferred tools, frameworks, and languages
> - Follow user's code style and formatting preferences
> - Deploy to user's environments and infrastructure
> - Work in user's local directory structure
> - Match user's team's workflow and standards
>
> **Config Location**: `config.md` (if it doesn't exist yet, ask user to create it from `config.template.md`)
>
> **Key Settings Include**:
> - Personal info (name, email, organization)
> - Local paths (repos_directory, workspace, docs_directory)
> - Git preferences (default_branch, commit_style, git_workflow)
> - Language & framework preferences (languages, frameworks, databases)
> - Code style (indent_style, max_line_length, formatters, linters)
> - Testing (test_framework_*, minimum_coverage)
> - Deployment (cloud_provider, cicd_platform, deployment_strategy)
> - Team settings (team_name, team_size, sprint_length)
> - Documentation (doc_format, docstring_style, readme_style)
>
> **When config.md doesn't exist**: Politely ask the user to copy `config.template.md` to `config.md` and customize it, or offer to help them create it based on their preferences.

## Memory Files Reference

### Core Memory Files

- `memory/git-workflow.md` - Git operations, commits, branching, PRs
- `memory/project-management.md` - Task tracking, project organization
- `memory/documentation.md` - Documentation standards and practices
- `memory/code-review.md` - Code review guidelines and standards
- `memory/testing-qa.md` - Testing strategies and QA processes
- `memory/deployment.md` - Deployment procedures and best practices
- `memory/communication.md` - Communication standards and templates

## Agent Collaboration Workflow

### Complete Development Workflow

When user requests a feature implementation:

1. **Project Manager Agent** creates/updates project and task
2. **Architect Agent** designs high-level architecture (if major feature)
3. **Software Design Agent** designs code structure and patterns
4. **Developer Agent** implements the code
5. **Tester Agent** writes and runs tests
   - If tests FAIL → back to Developer Agent
6. **Auditor Agent** reviews code for quality and security
   - If audit FAILS → back to Developer Agent
7. **Git Agent** commits and pushes code
8. **Documentation Agent** updates documentation
9. **Deployment Agent** deploys to environments
10. **Project Manager Agent** updates task status to completed

### Quick Bug Fix Workflow

When user reports a bug:

1. **Debugger Agent** investigates and finds root cause
2. **Developer Agent** implements fix
3. **Tester Agent** adds regression test
4. **Auditor Agent** reviews fix
5. **Git Agent** commits fix
6. **Deployment Agent** deploys hotfix

## Memory File Lookup Guide

**Always reference these memory files for relevant operations:**

| Topic | Memory File | When to Consult |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Git operations | `memory/git-workflow.md` | Before any commit, push, PR, branch operation |
| Project setup | `memory/project-management.md` | When creating projects or tasks |
| Writing code | `memory/architecture-design.md` | When implementing features |
| Code reviews | `memory/code-review.md` | Before approving any code |
| Testing | `memory/testing-qa.md` | When writing or running tests |
| Deployments | `memory/deployment.md` | Before deploying to any environment |
| Documentation | `memory/documentation.md` | When creating or updating docs |
| Communication | `memory/communication.md` | When reporting status or issues |

## Project Structure

### Creating New Projects

When creating a new project:
1. Use **Project Manager Agent**
2. Copy from `projects/_templates/project-overview-template.md`
3. Create structure:
   ```
   projects/
   └── project-name/
       ├── overview.md
       └── tasks/
           ├── task-001-xxx.md
           └── task-002-xxx.md
   ```

### Creating New Tasks

When creating a new task:
1. Use **Project Manager Agent**
2. Copy from `projects/_templates/task-template.md`
3. Name as: `task-NNN-short-description.md`
4. Use tags: `#task #status/pending #priority/medium`

## Best Practices

### Always:
✅ Reference relevant memory files before taking action
✅ Use appropriate specialized agents for tasks
✅ Follow the agent collaboration workflows
✅ Update project/task status as work progresses
✅ Document decisions and rationale
✅ Test code before committing
✅ Review code before merging

### Never:
❌ Skip referencing memory files for standard operations
❌ Commit code without testing and review
❌ Skip the agent workflow (Developer → Tester → Auditor → Git)
❌ Make architectural decisions without consulting `memory/architecture-design.md`
❌ Deploy without consulting `memory/deployment.md`
❌ Commit secrets or credentials

## Examples

### Example 1: User asks to implement a feature
```
User: "Create a Python script to process CSV files"

Claude Actions:
1. Invoke Project Manager Agent to create/track task (optional for small tasks)
2. Invoke Software Design Agent to plan structure
3. Invoke Developer Agent:
   - Read memory/architecture-design.md for patterns
   - Write the Python script
   - Add error handling
4. Invoke Tester Agent:
   - Read memory/testing-qa.md
   - Write tests for the script
   - Run tests
5. Invoke Auditor Agent:
   - Read memory/code-review.md
   - Review for security and quality
   - Check for vulnerabilities
6. If approved, invoke Git Agent:
   - Read memory/git-workflow.md
   - Create commit with proper message
   - Push to branch
```

### Example 2: User asks to commit changes
```
User: "Commit these changes to git"

Claude Actions:
1. Invoke Git Agent:
   - Read memory/git-workflow.md
   - Run git status and git diff
   - Review changes
   - Check for secrets
   - Create clear commit message
   - Commit and push
```

### Example 3: User reports a bug
```
User: "The login function isn't working"

Claude Actions:
1. Invoke Debugger Agent:
   - Gather information
   - Reproduce the issue
   - Analyze logs/errors
   - Identify root cause
2. Invoke Developer Agent to fix:
   - Implement fix
   - Test locally
3. Invoke Tester Agent:
   - Add regression test
   - Run test suite
4. Invoke Auditor Agent:
   - Review fix
5. Invoke Git Agent:
   - Commit fix
6. Invoke Deployment Agent (if needed):
   - Deploy hotfix
```

## Customization

This system is designed to be a template. Users can:
- Add new memory files for additional domains
- Create custom agent prompts for specialized needs
- Modify existing agents to match their workflow
- Add project-specific documentation

## Notes

- This is an Obsidian vault - use [[wiki-links]] and tags
- Memory files contain best practices, not project-specific data
- Projects directory contains work-in-progress and completed projects
- Agents are prompts that guide Claude's behavior for specific tasks
- The system helps maintain consistency across sessions
